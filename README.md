## Prompt
Help small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses secure Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contract awards. Using descriptive and diagnostic analytics, analyze patterns in the potential total value of awards granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

### Data Archive
Award Data Archive for the EPA can be found [here](https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/award_data_archive)


## Story
For small businesses, especially those owned by women, minorities, and those classified as small disadvantaged, this data trend shows decreasing opportunities to participate in government contracts. These businesses can be severely impacted by the unstable average contract value which can result in more critical consequences for small and disadvantaged businesses when compared to big businesses.


## Problem to Solve
The number of contracts for small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses has decreased significantly since 2020. Among these disadvantaged businesses, there is a disproportional allocation of contracts and dollar amounts being distributed, specifically against women.

### How?

Analyze data across each business over the years of 2020-2024.

## Actionable Insights
A more immediate solution is HavenProject.io. HavenProject.io is a platform that provides support and resources specifically tailored to women-owned businesses. The impact of HavenProject.io on women-owned businesses is significant as it helps address the unique challenges and barriers faced by women in entrepreneurship. It contributes to the advancement and success of women-owned businesses by providing them with the tools and support they need to thrive in today's competitive market.

A long term solution would be to find a relationship between number of disadvantaged business types and the number of contracts being given to each sub-category of these disadvantaged businesses (small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses). Use this relationship to implement policies that create a proportional ratio of number of businesses to number of contracts to allow fair distribution of contracts among disadvantaged businesses.
